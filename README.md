- 👋 Hi, I’m @AgileTD, an agile software testing conference from Germany.
- 👀 I’m interested in the field of agile software development and everything that evolves around it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use GitHub as non-developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with other peers who are interested in learning more about agile software development and its challenges.
- 📫 How to reach is easy. Just say my name, say my name...
